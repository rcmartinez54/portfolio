            <p class="about-text">
                My name is Raymond Martinez and I have recently relocated to the San Diego area to become a Web Developer.  Prior to my move I was working as an Athletic Trainer for the San Francisco 49ers and lived in San Jose, California.

            <p class="about-text">
                I have experience dating back to my time in the Navy where I was a Data Analyst / System Administrator in an F/A-18 squadron maintaining their NALCOMIS (Naval Aviation Logistics Command Management Information System).<br></br>

                My first dip into the HTML and CSS pool was while I was creating a "How To" instructional site while working on my Masters Degree in Human Resource Development while at Clemson University in 2013.  I was working as a Graduate Assistant for their football team.

                Fast forward five years and I decided to make a career change to chase my passion for creativity.  In the new year I have taken the time to learn how to code, utilizing Treehouse, FreeCodeAcademy, Codecademy and the MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) to build my own websites.
